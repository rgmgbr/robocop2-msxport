# The log of the rest of the game: the user's last changes, level 3 and the ending

Plans: `../LEVEL3.md` (level 3) and the steps' briefs. Branch `level2`. Each step appends one section:
what it did, the files, the commits, every check with its exact command and result, the open issues.

## Step 2: level 3's research and plan (2026-11-01)

**Done, offline (REA and Python only, no openMSX).** Worktree `g/wt02`, branch `g-s02` from
`2b44ca5`; scratch `S=$SCRATCH/g/s02`; archive `build/archive/level3_research_2026-11-01.tar.gz`.

### What it did
- **The RAM image** (`Makefile`): `level3_full.bin` is built with SPERMA under DATAL3 (`RB1 MU1 SPERMA
  DATAL3 PERMA`), as the Amiga holds it: SPERMA's tail `$5540C-$5884D` (13,378 B, types 4 and 12's
  frames) was zeros before. sha256 `700df44da0688c8cd616f368aa6014535fcc3e33a312404f92ca35eda73515ca`.
- **The bench plays level 3**: `tools/amigaemu.py game --level 3` (`Level3Bench`: Level2Bench's direct
  start with `$8050` = `$8052` = 2, `--stop-at-end` at `$8050` = 3, `CODE_BLOCKS_L3` from the
  coverage's code-area writes) and `tools/amigacov.py --level 3 --scenario level3`.
- **The names**: `analysis/main_8000.sym` (level 3's block and ten `+entry` seeds),
  `analysis/ghidra_seeds.tsv` regenerated (126 functions, 303 labels).
- **The plan**: `docs/LEVEL3.md` (the original, the design, the checks, steps A-E, 15 defaults, the
  risks); `docs/AMIGA_ANALYSIS.md` (a level-3 section); `docs/ROM_BUDGET.md` 7 (two tooling items done).

### Commits
- `934e2f1` Makefile (level 3's RAM image).
- `d0afe4c` the bench, the coverage, the names and seeds.
- `5546686` the docs (this section, `docs/LEVEL3.md`, the ledger, `ROM_BUDGET.md` 7).
- Integrated into `level2` (clean tree, from `2b44ca5`) by cherry-pick as **`1a2edef`, `fe12770`,
  `9150383`**. In the main tree then: `build/ram/level3_full.bin` rebuilt with the Makefile's line
  (sha256 `700df44d…3515ca`); the product built from it (`sh tools/bstest/build.sh OUT.rom`) is
  byte-identical to `2b44ca5`'s (no ROM source changed); `amigaemu.py game --level 3 --gframes 200
  --god` runs (201 game frames, `$8050` 2).

### Checks (each with its command and result)
- The image: `python3 -I tools/ramimage.py build/extracted build/ram/level3 RB1 MU1 SPERMA DATAL3 PERMA`
  → SPERMA `$4b68a-$5884e`, DATAL3 `$28000-$5540c`; zeros in `$5540C-$5884D` 13,378 → 5,312 (the data's
  own zeros); `$8000-$125FF` equal to `level2_full.bin`'s (first difference `$28080`).
- REA seeds: `REA_GHIDRA_SEED_FILE=analysis/ghidra_seeds.tsv npx -y rea-agents@6.7.0 instructions
  build/ram/level3_full.bin 0xc398 --target-format raw-binary --architecture m68k --entry-point 0x0
  --provider ghidra --format json` → "125 functions created, 1 already present, 0 failed; 303 labels
  applied, 0 failed"; `$C398` named `debris_add`.
- The bench unchanged for levels 1 and 2: `tools/amigaemu.py game [--level 2] --gframes 300 --trace
  OUT --trace-ram --joy 70:200:rf` with the base's `amigaemu.py` (the main tree at `2b44ca5`) and this
  one: level 1 `02a902bf232125bd…`, level 2 `b3f75b3e8b7b3a42…`, both byte-identical.
- `python3 -I -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_level2_bench.py'` with the venv's Python: 15 OK.
- The coverage: `~/.venvs/msxports/bin/python -I tools/amigacov.py --level 3 --scenario level3
  $S/cov_level3.json` → 1,150 blocks, 11,176 bytes of code run, 173 code-area addresses written, 183
  BOB frames, types 4, 12, 21, 22, 33-43, 47, 48, 50, 51, 52 (every spawned type), 610 s.
- Cain: `$S/py/bossrun.py <tree> OUT FRAMES loop|fight2200|kill2050` (Level3Bench, god mode): "CHASE
  CAIN" at game frame 243 (at 250 RoboCop at (1176, 91), Cain at (1237, 56)); Cain at y 255 with 44 hit points
  from then on; killed after the poke at frame 820: "CAIN DESTROYED." at 868, `$16D0` set, the bench
  at `level_init` with `$8050` = 3 at 962; 19 frames more than the coverage (202 in all).
- The palette: `python3 -I tools/msxlvpal.py palette build/extracted/files/DATAL3_22.bin --pal-file
  build/extracted/boot/main_8000.bin --base-addr 0xfff6 --pal-addr 0x10036 --base build/msx/robocop
  --rows 50 -o $S/l3conv/level3` → mean ΔE76 C 2.179, A 2.675; `cmp level3.pal build/msx/level2.pal`
  and the remaps: identical.
- The map: `python3 -I tools/msxconv.py level build/extracted/files/DATAL3_22.bin --pal-file
  build/extracted/boot/main_8000.bin --pal-addr 0x10036 --rows 50 --joint $S/l3conv/level3 -o
  $S/l3conv/level3` → 485 offsets (481 tiles), 505 tiles, 64,640 B; a scan of `level3.map`: at most 106
  distinct tiles in 19 × 14 cells, 102 in 17 × 14 (the same scan gives level 2's 107 and 103).
- The free bytes: `sh tools/bstest/build.sh $S/R/prod/rc2.rom` (and `DIAG=1 PZ_TEST=1`, `LV_TEST=2
  CHEAT=1`), `python3 -I tools/bstest/l2base.py banks $S` → `docs/LEVEL3.md` 3.2's table (fixed area
  181 / 162 / 46, FRONT 1,381 / 1,326 / 983, `BANK_FIELD` 143, `BANK_L2` 28). Builds OK, 12 known
  z80asm warnings.
- `make test` → 321 tests, the 4 known failures only (failures=3, errors=1, skipped=54).

### Open issues
- Cain's chase in a drive without god mode (the `kill` reference of `docs/LEVEL3.md` 3.8) is step A's
  or D's: the drives here put RoboCop on the ground floor and Cain stayed on row 20.
- The frames the bench did not draw (rare states of Cain, types 36, 37) come from REA's tables in step C.
- The ending's hook needs step 3's entry name (until then `$8050` = 3 goes to the title).
